Jenkins stores all its system and job configuration details as XML files and all XML files are stored in the Jenkins home directory. Jenkins also stores all of the build histories.

Jenkins Pipeline can be defined by a text file called JenkinsFile. You can implement pipeline as code using JenkinsFile, and this can be defined by using a DSL (Domain Specific Language). With the help of JenkinsFile, you can write the steps required for running a Jenkins Pipeline.
